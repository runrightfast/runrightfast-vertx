1. co.runrightfast.vertx.demo.VertxApp
    - main class
    - shows how easy it is to start a RunRightFast Vertx app
    - the code to launch the app is centralized in co.runrightfast.vertx.core.application.RunRightFastVertxApplicationLauncher
    - provide a CLI - current options supported are:

      -c,--config    Show the application configuration as JSON
      -h,--help      Print usage
      -v,--version   Show the application version

    - registers an application MBean under the co.runrightfast JMX domain
      - used to view the deployed application version
      - exposes an operation to shutdown the app
2. Framework provides support to make it easy to develop, configure, and deploy verticles     
3. Vertx is embedded
    - see co.runrightfast.vertx.core.VertxService and its implementation
3. Application configuration is managed via TypeSafe config
4. Dagger 2 is used for DI
    - component interfaces package: co.runrightfast.vertx.core.components
      - the RunRightFastVertxApplication component interface is the main application component

   - HealthChecks can be discovered and run via JMX
   - Each verticle has its owne HealthCheck registry

     - this is supported by the RunRightFastVerticle base class
     - sub-classes must implement: abstract Set<RunRightFastHealthCheck> getHealthChecks()
